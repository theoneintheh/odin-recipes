        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>Enchiladas suizas verdes</em> is a popular Mexican dish made with corn tortillas stuffed with shredded chicken and bathed with a creamy green sauce flavored with hints of cilantro and jalape√±o. The dish is then topped with cheese and baked to perfection.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>9 Tomatillos, husked and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/4 White Onion</li>
            <li>1 serrano chile</li>
            <li>1 yellow chile (guerito peper)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Mexican crema</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, frying</li>
            <li>6 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup shredded chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Oaxaca or mozarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Put the tomatillos, onion and both chiles in a medium heavy saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the tomatillos turn an olive-green color, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer the tomatillos, onions and chiles to a blender. Add the garlic and cilantro and blend until smooth. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix the Mexican crema and heavy cream together in a small bowl and season with salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas until golden but still pliable, about 10 seconds per side, using more oil if needed. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Place the tortillas on a work surface. Divide the shredded chicken evenly among the tortillas and roll up each like a cigar. Spread 1/3 cup of the sauce in a 13-by-9-by-2-inch glass baking dish. Arrange the enchiladas in 1 layer, seam-side down, snugly inside the dish. Pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas. Drizzle the cream mixture on top and sprinkle the cheese all over.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and starting to brown in spots, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
